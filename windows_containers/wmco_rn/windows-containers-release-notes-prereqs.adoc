= Windows Machine Config Operator prerequisites
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

The following information details the supported platform versions, Windows Server versions, and networking configurations for the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO). See the vSphere documentation for any information that is relevant to only that platform.

[id="wmco-prerequisites-supported-install_{context}"]
== WMCO supported installation method

The WMCO fully supports installing Windows nodes into installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) clusters. This is the preferred {product-title} installation method.

For user-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) clusters, the WMCO supports installing Windows nodes only into a UPI cluster installed with the `platform: none` field set in the `install-config.yaml` file (bare-metal or provider-agnostic) and only for the xref:../../windows_containers/byoh-windows-instance.adoc#byoh-windows-instance[BYOH (Bring Your Own Host)] use case. UPI is not supported for any other platform.

== WMCO 10-19.0 supported platforms and Windows Server versions

The following table lists the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-server-release-info[Windows Server versions] that are supported by WMCO 10-19.0, based on the applicable platform. Windows Server versions not listed are not supported and attempting to use them will cause errors. To prevent these errors, use only an appropriate version for your platform.

== Supported networking

Hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes is the only supported networking configuration. See the additional resources below for more information on this functionality. The following tables outline the type of networking configuration and Windows Server versions to use based on your platform. You must specify the network configuration when you install the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
* The WMCO does not support OVN-Kubernetes without hybrid networking or OpenShift SDN.
* Dual NIC is not supported on WMCO-managed Windows instances.
