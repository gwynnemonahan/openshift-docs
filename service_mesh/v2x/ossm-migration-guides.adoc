.Migrating from Jaeger to OpenTelemetry

In preparation for the release of {SMProductName} version 3.0, you need to migrate from the {JaegerName} to the {OTELName}, which is based on the OpenTelemetry open-source project.

To migrate, follow the {OTELName} migration steps: xref:../../../observability/otel/otel-migrating.html[Migrating]


//REMOVE when OSSM 3.0 is being release. Creating this new assembly for migration guides for 2.6. This will help Service Mesh users get accustomed to seeing it in preparation for additional content to be added to help users migrating from OSSM 2.6 to OSSM 2.0. It is also the most logical way to present/link to migration content from Distributed Tracing and other areas of OCP so that it doesn't get lost. The intent of these guides is for users to be able to more easily move from OSSM 2.6 to OSSm 3.0.


//.Prerequisites
//place holder as may be needed for 2.6 to 3.0 migration content. This content is still undetermined.

//[NOTE] Leaving as reference points as this assembly gets built out with addition content/information.
//====
//Because {SMProductName} releases on a different cadence from {product-title} and because the {SMProductName} Operator supports deploying multiple versions of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, the {SMProductShortName} documentation does not maintain separate documentation sets for minor versions of the product.  The current documentation set applies to the most recent version of {SMProductShortName} unless version-specific limitations are called out in a particular topic or for a particular feature.

//For additional information about the {SMProductName} life cycle and supported platforms, refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ossm[Platform Life Cycle Policy].
