== Validating encryptions with Kiali

The Kiali console offers several ways to validate whether or not your applications, services, and workloads have mTLS encryption enabled.

The *Services Detail Overview* page displays a *Security* icon on the graph edges where at least one request with mTLS enabled is present. Also note that Kiali displays a lock icon in the *Network* section next to ports that are configured for mTLS.
