This document describes how to manage compute (also known as worker) nodes with {product-title}.

The majority of changes for compute nodes are configured on machine pools. A machine pool is a group of compute nodes in a cluster that have the same configuration, providing ease of management.

You can edit machine pool configuration options such as scaling, adding node labels, and adding taints.

You can also create new machine pools with Capacity Reservations.

.Overview of AWS Capacity Reservations

If you have reserved compute capacity using link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/capacity-reservation-overview.html[AWS Capacity Reservations] for a specific instance type and Availability Zone (AZ), you can use it for your {product-title} worker nodes. Both On-Demand Capacity Reservations and Capacity Blocks for machine learning (ML) workloads are supported.

Purchase and manage a Capacity Reservation directly with AWS. After reserving the capacity, add a Capacity Reservation ID to a new machine pool when you create it in your {product-title} cluster. You can also use a Capacity Reservation shared with you from another AWS account within your AWS Organization.

Once you configure Capacity Reservations in {product-title}, you can use your AWS account to monitor reserved capacity usage across all workloads in the account.

Using Capacity Reservations on machine pools in {product-title} clusters has the following prerequisites and limitations:

* You have installed the {rosa-cli} version 1.2.57 or above.
* Your {product-title} cluster is version 4.19 or later.
* The cluster already has a machine pool that is not using a Capacity Reservation or taints. The machine pool must have at least 2 worker nodes.
* You have purchased a Capacity Reservation for the instance type required in the AZ of the machine pool that you are creating.
* You can only add a Capacity Reservation ID to a new machine pool.
* You cannot use autoscaling on a machine pool with configured Capacity Reservations.
* You cannot upgrade a machine pool with configured Capacity Reservations.

To create a machine pool with a Capacity Reservation, see xref:../../rosa_cluster_admin/rosa_nodes/rosa-managing-worker-nodes.adoc#creating_machine_pools_cli_capres_rosa-managing-worker-nodes[Creating a machine pool with Capacity Reservations using the {rosa-cli}].
