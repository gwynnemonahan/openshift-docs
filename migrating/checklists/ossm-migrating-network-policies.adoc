toc::[]

In {SMProductName} 2, network policies are created by default when the `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy` field is set to `true` in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. During the migration to {SMProduct} 3, these policies are removed.

It is recommended to re-create your network policies after you have migrated your deployment and workloads. However, if your security policies require you to keep your network policies, you must re-create them first, and then set the `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy` field to `false` as outlined in the migration checklists.

* In {SMProduct} 2, set the `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy` field to `false` in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, and continue with the migration checklists.
