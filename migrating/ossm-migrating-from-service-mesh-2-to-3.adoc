The content in this migration section applies only in the following cases:

* You are an existing {SMProductName} user running {SMProduct} {SMv2Version}.
* You want to move to {SMProduct} 3.0.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are not running {SMProduct} {smv2version}, you must update before you can continue. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/service_mesh/service-mesh-2-x#upgrading-ossm[Upgrading Service Mesh].
====

During the migration process, you might need to reference, or you might be directed to {SMProduct} 2.x content. It can be beneficial to open link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/service_mesh/service-mesh-2-x[OpenShift Service Mesh 2.x] in a new tab or window for easier reference. This can be especially helpful when you move between {SMProduct} 2 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource content and {SMProduct} 3 `Istio` resource content.
