At this stage, you have completed the migration process. It is safe to remove {SMProduct} {smv2version}, complete the migration of the cert-manager tool, and setup network policies.

//need to add cleanup/delete 2.6 content

Optionally, if you already have Kiali installed, before you delete {SMProduct} {SMv2Version}, you can verify that all data plane namespaces have been migrated by checking the Kiali Mesh page. To learn more about the Kiali Mesh page, see: link:https://kiali.io/docs/features/istio-component-status/#control-plane-namespace[Istio infrastrcuture status (Kiali.io)]

//content taken from https://github.com/openshift-service-mesh/sail-operator/tree/main/docs/ossm/ossm2-migration#post-migration-checklist which is a new addition to the Premigration Checklist content as of 01/27/2025 even though it is post migration content. However, the engineering staging area, /docs/ossm/ doesn't have a post migration folder, so making note here for reference so whomever else is in this file doesn't have to go digging.

//includes coming.
