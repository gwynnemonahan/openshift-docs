* ** New cluster deletion policy.**
{product-title} clusters now have a new deletion policy. This policy is based on a set time period of customer non-response to service notifications. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html-single/introduction_to_rosa/index#rosa-delete-policy_rosa-hcp-life-cycle[Deletion policy]. For specific revised terms and conditions, refer to link:https://www.redhat.com/licenses/Appendix-4-Red-Hat-Online-Services-20250805.pdf[Product Appendix 4].

* **Shared VPC for {product-title} clusters.** You can create {product-title} clusters in shared, centrally-managed AWS virtual private clouds (VPCs). For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html-single/install_clusters/index#rosa-hcp-shared-vpc-config[Configuring a shared VPC for ROSA with HCP clusters].

* **Deprecated `--private-link` flags for {product-title} clusters**. Architectural changes to the ROSA CLI 1.2.55 make networking more flexible for {product-title} clusters. The `--private-link` flag previously used when creating a {product-title} cluster is now deprecated in favor of the `--private` and `--default-ingress-private` flags. Now, users can choose to have a combination of a public or private API with a public or private ingress. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html-single/install_clusters/index#rosa-hcp-aws-private-create-cluster_rosa-hcp-aws-private-creating-cluster[Creating a private cluster on {product-title}].

* **Changed default ingress listening method to begin with Day 1 operations**. Previously, the default ingress listening method was a Day 2 operation. Now, the default ingress listening method is a Day 1 operation.
