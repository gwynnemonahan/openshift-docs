= Network observability metrics dashboards

In the {product-title} console on the *Overview* tab, you can view the overall aggregated metrics of the network traffic flow on the cluster. You can choose to display the information by cluster, node, namespace, owner, pod, and service. Filters and display options can further refine the metrics. For more information, see "Observing the network traffic from the Overview view".

In *Observe* -> *Dashboards*, the *Netobserv* dashboards provide a quick overview of the network flows in your {product-title} cluster. The *Netobserv/Health* dashboard provides metrics about the health of the Operator. For more information, see "Network observability metrics" and "Viewing health information".
