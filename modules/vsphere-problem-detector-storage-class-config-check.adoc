= About the storage class configuration check

The datastore name and cluster ID relate to the names for persistent volumes that use {vmw-full} storage. After the creation of a persistent volume, `systemd` creates a mount unit for the persistent volume. 

The `systemd` process has a 255 character limit for the length of the fully qualified path to the virtual machine disk (VMDK) file. This path follows the naming conventions for `systemd` and {vmw-short}. The naming conventions use the following example pattern:

[source,text]
----
/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume/mounts/[<datastore>] 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/<cluster_id>-dynamic-pvc-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.vmdk
----

* The naming conventions require 205 characters of the 255 character limit.

* The depolyment determines the datastore name and the cluster ID.

* The datastore name and cluster ID substitute into the example pattern. The fully qualified path gets processed with the `systemd-escape` command to escape special characters. For example, after the escape operation, a hyphen character uses four characters, such as `\x2d`.

* After the `systemd-escape` CLI processes the VMDK file path, the length of the path must not be lower than 255 characters. This criteria ensures that the `systemd` process can access the fully qualified VMDK file path.
