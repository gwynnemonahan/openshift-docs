= Disabling the CPU hot plug by instance type

[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can disable the CPU hot plug by instance type.
This is the recommended approach to standardize VM configurations and ensure NUMA-aware CPU allocation without hot plugs for specific instance types.

When a VM is created by using an instance type where the CPU hot plug is disabled, the VM inherits these settings and the CPU hot plug is disabled for that VM.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for a `VirtualMachineClusterInstancetype` custom resource (CR). Add a `maxSockets` spec to the instance type that you want to configure:
+
.Example `VirtualMachineClusterInstancetype` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: instancetype.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualMachineClusterInstancetype
metadata:
  name: cx1.mycustom-numa-instance
spec:
  cpu:
    dedicatedCPUPlacement: true
    isolateEmulatorThread: true
    numa:
      guestMappingPassthrough: {}
    guest: 8
    maxSockets: 8
  memory:
    guest: 16Gi
    hugepages:
      pageSize: 1Gi
----
+
where:
+
spec.cpu.dedicatedCPUPlacement:: Specifies whether dedicated resources are allocated to the VM instance. If this is set to `true`, the VM's VCPUs are pinned to physical host CPUs. This is often used for high-performance workloads to minimize scheduling jitter.
+
spec.cpu.isolateEmulatorThread:: Specifies whether the QEMU emulator thread should be isolated and run on a dedicated physical CPU core. This is a performance optimization that is typically used alongside the `dedicatedCPUPlacement` spec.
+
spec.cpu.numa:: Specifies the NUMA topology configuration for the VM.
+
spec.cpu.numa.guestMappingPassthrough:: Specifies that the VM's NUMA topology should directly pass through the NUMA topology of the underlying host machine. This is critical for applications that are NUMA-aware and require optimal performance.
+
spec.cpu.guest:: Specifies the total number of vCPUs to be allocated to the VM.
+
spec.cpu.maxSockets:: Specifies the maximum number of CPU sockets the VM is allowed to have.
+
spec.memory:: Specifies the memory configuration for the VM.
+
spec.memory.guest:: Specifies the total amount of memory to be allocated to the VM.
+
spec.memory.hugepages:: Specifies configuration related to hugepages.
+
spec.memory.hugepages.pageSize:: Specifies the size of the hugepages to be used for the VM's memory.

. Create the `VirtualMachineClusterInstancetype` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
----

.Verification

. Create a VM that uses the updated `VirtualMachineClusterInstancetype` configuration.

. Inspect the configuration of the created VM by running the following command and inspecting the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get vmi <vm_name> -o yaml
----
+
*Example output*
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
metadata:
  name: example-vmi
  labels:
    instancetype.kubevirt.io/cluster-instancetype: cx1.example-numa-instance
spec:
  domain:
    cpu:
      dedicatedCPUPlacement: true
      isolateEmulatorThread: true
      sockets: 8
      cores: 1
      threads: 1
      numa:
        guestMappingPassthrough: {}
      guest: 8
      maxSockets: 8
# ...
----
+
The update has applied successfully if in the `spec.template.spec.domain.cpu` section:
+
* The `sockets` value matches the `maxSockets` and `guest` values from the instance type, which ensures that no extra hot plug slots are configured.
* The `dedicatedCPUPlacement` and `isolateEmulatorThread` fields are present and set to `true`.
