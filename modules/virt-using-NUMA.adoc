= Using NUMA topology with {VirtProductName}

You must enable the NUMA functionality for {VirtProductName} VMs to prevent performance degradation on nodes with multiple NUMA zones. This feature is vital for high-performance and latency-sensitive workloads.

Without NUMA awareness, a VM's virtual CPUs might run on one physical NUMA zone, while its memory is allocated on another. This "cross-node" communication significantly increases latency and reduces memory bandwidth, and can cause the interconnect buses which link the NUMA zones to become a bottleneck.

When you enable the NUMA functionality for {VirtProductName} VMs, you allow the host to pass its physical topology directly to the VM's guest operating system (OS).
The guest OS can then make intelligent, NUMA-aware decisions about scheduling and memory allocation. This ensures that process threads and memory are kept on the same physical NUMA node. By aligning the virtual topology with the physical one, you minimize latency and maximize performance.
