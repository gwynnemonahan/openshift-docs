= Monitoring

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release.

Description::
The Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) is included by default in {product-title} and provides monitoring (metrics, dashboards, and alerting) for the platform components and optionally user projects.
You can customize the default log retention period, custom alert rules, and so on.
+
Configuration of the monitoring stack is done through a single string value in the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap. The reference tuning tuning merges content from two requirements:

* Prometheus configuration is extended to forward alerts to the ACM hub cluster for alert aggregation.
If desired this configuration can be extended to forward to additional locations.
* Prometheus retention period is reduced from the default.
The primary metrics storage is expected to be external to the cluster.
Metrics storage on the Core cluster is expected to be a backup to that central store and available for local troubleshooting purposes.
+
In addition to the default configuration, the following metrics are expected to be configured for telco core clusters:

* Pod CPU and memory metrics and alerts for user workloads

Engineering considerations::
* The Prometheus retention period is specified by the user.
The value used is a tradeoff between operational requirements for maintaining historical data on the cluster against CPU and storage resources.
Longer retention periods increase the need for storage and require additional CPU to manage the indexing of data.
