= Cluster-wide migration methods

You can migrate the control plane from {SMProductName} {SMv2Version} to {SMProduct} 3.0 by using one of the following methods:

* Applying the `istio.io/rev` label
* Applying the `istio-injection=enabled` label
* Performing a simple migration by using the `istio-injection=enabled` label

[NOTE]
====
The simple migration method might introduce traffic disruptions.

To select the best migration method for your {SMProduct} installation, you must understand the difference between the `istio.io/rev` and `istio-injection` labels. Read through all the migration methods before choosing the one that best fits your needs.
