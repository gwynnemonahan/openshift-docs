= About the {operator-name}

The {operator-name} checks a cluster that you deployed on {vmw-full} for common installation and configuration issues that relate to storage.

After the Cluster Storage Operator starts and determines that a cluster runs on {vmw-full}, the Cluster Storage Operator launches the {operator-name}. When the {operator-name} starts, the Operator immediately runs the checks. The {operator-name} communicates with the {vmw-short} vCenter Server to find the virtual machines in the cluster, the default datastore, and other information about the {vmw-short} vCenter Server configuration. The Operator uses the credentials from the Cloud Credential Operator to connect to {vmw-short}.

The Operator runs the checks according to the following schedule:

* The checks run every hour.

* If any check fails, the Operator runs the checks again in intervals of 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4, 8, and so on. The Operator doubles the interval up to a maximum interval of 8 hours.

* When all checks pass, the schedule returns to an hour interval.

After a failure, the Operator increases its check frequency to quickly report success when the failure condition gets resolved. You can run the Operator manually for immediate troubleshooting information.
