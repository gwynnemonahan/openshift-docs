= Telco core common baseline model

The following configurations and use models are applicable to all telco core use cases.
The telco core use cases build on this common baseline of features.

Cluster topology::

The telco core reference design supports two distinct cluster configuration variants:

* A non-schedulable control plane variant, where user workloads are strictly prohibited from running on master nodes.

* A schedulable control plane variant, which allows for user workloads to run on master nodes to optimize resource utilization. This variant is only applicable to bare-metal control plane nodes and must be configured at installation time.
+
All clusters, regardless of the variant, must conform to the following requirements:

* A highly available control plane consisting of three or more nodes.

* The use of multiple machine config pools.

Storage::
Telco core use cases require highly available persistent storage as provided by an external storage solution.
{rh-storage} might be used to manage access to the external storage.

Networking::
Telco core cluster networking conforms to the following requirements:

* Dual stack IPv4/IPv6 (IPv4 primary).
* Fully disconnected - clusters do not have access to public networking at any point in their lifecycle.
* Supports multiple networks.
Segmented networking provides isolation between operations, administration and maintenance (OAM), signaling, and storage traffic.
* Cluster network type is OVN-Kubernetes as required for IPv6 support.
* Telco core clusters have multiple layers of networking supported by underlying RHCOS, SR-IOV Network Operator, Load Balancer and other components.
These layers include the following:
** Cluster networking layer.
The cluster network configuration is defined and applied through the installation configuration.
Update the configuration during Day 2 operations with the NMState Operator.
Use the initial configuration to establish the following:
*** Host interface configuration.
*** Active/active bonding (LACP).
** Secondary/additional network layer.
Configure the {product-title} CNI through network `additionalNetwork` or `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRs.
Use the initial configuration to configure MACVLAN virtual network interfaces.
** Application workload layer.
User plane networking runs in cloud-native network functions (CNFs).

Service Mesh::
Telco CNFs can use Service Mesh.
Telco core clusters typically include a Service Mesh implementation.
The choice of implementation and configuration is outside the scope of this specification.
