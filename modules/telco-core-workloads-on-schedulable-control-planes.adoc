= Workloads on schedulable control planes

Enabling workloads on control plane nodes::

You can enable schedulable control planes to run workloads on control plane nodes, utilizing idle CPU capacity on bare-metal machines for potential cost savings. This feature is only applicable to clusters with bare-metal control plane nodes.
+
There are two distinct parts to this functionality:

. Allowing workloads on control plane nodes: This feature can be configured after initial cluster installation, allowing you to enable it when you need to run workloads on those nodes.
. Enabling workload partitioning: This is a critical isolation measure that protects the control plane from interference by regular workloads, ensuring cluster stability and reliability. Workload partitioning must be configured during the initial "day zero" cluster installation and cannot be enabled later.

If you plan to run workloads on your control plane nodes, you must first enable workload partitioning during the initial setup. You can then enable the schedulable control plane feature at a later time.

Workload characterization and limitations::

You must test and verify workloads to ensure that applications do not interfere with core cluster functions. It is recommended that you start with lightweight containers that do not heavily load the CPU or networking.
+
Certain workloads are not permitted on control plane nodes due to the risk to cluster stability. This includes any workload that reconfigures kernel arguments or system global sysctls, as this can lead to unpredictable outcomes for the cluster.
+
To ensure stability, you must adhere to the following:

* Make sure all non-trivial workloads have memory limits defined. This protects the control plane in case of a memory leak.
* Avoid excessively loading reserved CPUs, for example, by heavy use of exec probes.
* Avoid heavy kernel-based networking usage, as it can increase reserved CPU load through software networking components such as OVS.

NUMA Resources Operator support::

The NUMA Resources Operator is supported for use on control plane nodes. Functional behavior of the Operator remains unchanged.
