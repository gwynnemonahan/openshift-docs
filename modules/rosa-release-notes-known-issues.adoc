= Known issues

* The OpenShift Cluster Manager roles (`ocm-role`) and user roles (`user-role`) that are key to the {product-title} provisioning wizard might get enabled accidentally in your Red{nbsp}Hat organization by another user. However, this behavior does not affect the usability.
* The `htpasswd` identity provider does not function as expected in all scenarios against the `rosa create admin` function.

[id="rosa-deprecated-removed-features_{context}"]
== Deprecated and removed features
Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed. Deprecated functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

* **Disable workload monitoring**. Previously, users could disable workload monitoring on {product-title} clusters. However, to allow users to own the full Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) stack on {product-title} clusters, the ability to disable workload monitoring has been deprecated. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html-single/monitoring/index#preparing-to-configure-the-monitoring-stack-uwm[Preparing to configure the user workload monitoring stack].

* **{product-title} non-STS deployment mode.** {product-title} non-STS deployment mode is no longer the preferred method for new clusters. Instead, users must deploy {product-title} with the STS mode. This deprecation is in line with our new {product-title} provisioning wizard UI experience on the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/rosa/wizard[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].

* **Label removal on core namespaces.** {product-title} is no longer labeling OpenShift core using the `name` label. Customers should migrate to referencing the `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` label if needed for Network Policies or other use cases.
