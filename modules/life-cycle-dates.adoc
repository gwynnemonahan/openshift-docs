The Extended Update Support Add-On - Term 1 is now available for {product-title} customers using even-numbered versions, starting with 4.16, and is included at no additional cost with your {product-title} subscription.

The Extended Update Support Add-On - Term 1 provides the key benefit of extending the support lifecycle for an eligible minor release from 18 months to a total of 24 months. This 6-month extension allows organizations to maintain stability for mission-critical applications, meet complex regulatory validation schedules, and manage limited maintenance windows by providing continued access to critical and important security updates and urgent-priority bug fixes without requiring a full version upgrade.

To apply Extended Update Support Add-On - Term 1 to your {product-title} cluster, you must update the channel group to `eus`.
