= Introducing canary updates

{SMProductName} 2 supported only in-place style updates, which created risk for large meshes where, after the control plane was updated, all workloads must update to the new control plane version without a simple way to roll back if something goes wrong.

{SMProduct} 3 retains support for simple in-place style updates, and adds support for canary-style updates of the Istio control plane using Istio's revision feature.

The `Istio` resource manages Istio revision labels using the `IstioRevision` resource. When the `Istio` resource's `updateStrategy` type is set to `RevisionBased`, it creates Istio revision labels using the `Istio` resource's name combined with the Istio version, for example `mymesh-v1-21-2`.

During an updates, a new `IstioRevision` deploys the new Istio control plane with an updated revision label, for example `mymesh-v1-22-0`. Workloads can then be migrated between control planes using the revision label on namespaces or workloads, for example `istio.io/rev=mymesh-v1-22-0`.

Setting your `updateStrategy` to `RevisionBased` also has implications for integrations, such as the cert-manager tool, and gateways.
