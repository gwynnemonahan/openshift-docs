= Network Observability CLI

You can quickly debug and troubleshoot networking issues with network observability by using the Network Observability command-line interface (CLI), `oc netobserv`. The Network Observability CLI is a flow and packet visualization tool that relies on eBPF agents to stream collected data to an ephemeral collector pod. It requires no persistent storage during the capture. After the run, the output is transferred to your local machine. This enables quick, live insight into packets and flow data without installing the Network Observability Operator.
