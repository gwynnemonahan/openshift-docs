= Completing your migration

Depending on your deployment model, you might need to take extra steps to complete the migration. For example, when you migrate with the cert-manager tool, you need to take additional steps before you can remove {SMProduct} 2 resources.

After you complete your migration, you can add new workloads, re-create network policies, and remove {SMProduct} 2 resources.
