= Creating custom alert rules

[role="_abstract"]
Use the Prometheus Query Language (`PromQL`) to define a custom `AlertingRule` resource to trigger alerts based on specific network metrics (e.g., traffic surges).

.Prerequisites

* Familiarity with `PromQL`.
* You have installed {product-title} 4.14 or later.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the Network Observability Operator.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file named `custom-alert.yaml` that contains your `AlertingRule` resource.
. Apply the custom alert rule by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f custom-alert.yaml
----

.Verification

. Verify that the `PrometheusRule` resource was created in the `netobserv` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get prometheusrules -n netobserv -oyaml
----
+
The output should include the `netobserv-alerts` rule you just created, confirming that the resource was generated correctly.

. Confirm the rule is active by checking the *Network Health* dashboard in the {product-title} web console â†’ *Observe*.
