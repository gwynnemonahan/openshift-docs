Some CNF workloads make use of sysctls which are not in the list of system-wide safe sysctls.
Generally, network sysctls are namespaced and you can enable them using the `kubeletconfig.experimental` annotation in the `PerformanceProfile` Custom Resource (CR) as a string of JSON in the following form:

apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  name: {{ .metadata.name }}
  annotations:kubeletconfig.experimental: |
      {"allowedUnsafeSysctls":["net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra"]}
# ...

[NOTE]
====
Although these sysctls are namespaced, they may allow a pod to consume memory or other resources beyond any limits specified in the pod description.
You must ensure that these sysctls do not exhaust platform resources.
