= {PM-kepler} hardware support

{PM-kepler} is the key component of {PM-shortname} that collects real-time CPU power consumption data from a node through the RAPL Subsystem. By understanding the total power consumption of the node and calculating the percent of CPU time each process is using, it is able to estimate the power consumption at a per process and container level.

Kernel Power Management Subsystem::
* `rapl-sysfs`: This requires access to the `/sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl` directory.
