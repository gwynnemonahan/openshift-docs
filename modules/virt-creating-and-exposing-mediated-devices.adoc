= Creating and exposing mediated devices

As an administrator, you can create mediated devices and expose them to the cluster by editing the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR). Before you edit the CR, explore a worker node to find the configuration values that are specific to your hardware devices.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {oc-first}.
* You enabled the Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) driver.
* If your hardware vendor provides drivers, you installed them on the nodes where you want to create mediated devices.
** If you use NVIDIA cards, you link:https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/openshift-virtualization.html[installed the NVIDIA GRID driver].

// [IMPORTANT]
// ====
// Before {VirtProductName} 4.14, the `mediatedDeviceTypes` field was named `mediatedDevicesTypes`. Ensure that you use the correct field name when configuring mediated devices.
// ====

.Procedure

. Identify the name selector and resource name values for the mediated devices by exploring a worker node:

.. Start a debugging session with the worker node by using the `oc debug` command. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/node-11.redhat.com
----

.. Change the root directory of the shell process to the file system of the host node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# chroot /host
----

.. Navigate to the `mdev_bus` directory and view its contents. Each subdirectory name is a PCI address of a physical GPU. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# cd sys/class/mdev_bus && ls
----
+
Example output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
0000:4b:00.4
----

.. Go to the directory for your physical device and list the supported mediated device types as defined by the hardware vendor. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# cd 0000:4b:00.4 && ls mdev_supported_types
----
+
Example output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
nvidia-742  nvidia-744	nvidia-746  nvidia-748	nvidia-750  nvidia-752
nvidia-743  nvidia-745	nvidia-747  nvidia-749	nvidia-751  nvidia-753
----

.. Select the mediated device type that you want to use and identify its name selector value by viewing the contents of its `name` file. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# cat nvidia-745/name
---- 
+
Example output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NVIDIA A2-2Q
----

. Open the `HyperConverged` CR in your default editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n {CNVNamespace}
----

. Create and expose the mediated devices by updating the configuration:

.. Create mediated devices by adding them to the `spec.mediatedDevicesConfiguration` stanza.

.. Expose the mediated devices to the cluster by adding the `mdevNameSelector` and `resourceName` values to the `spec.permittedHostDevices.mediatedDevices` stanza. The `resourceName` value is based on the `mdevNameSelector` value, but you use underscores instead of spaces.

Example `HyperConverged` CR:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: {CNVNamespace}
spec:
  mediatedDevicesConfiguration:
    mediatedDeviceTypes:
    - nvidia-745
    nodeMediatedDeviceTypes:

where:

`mediatedDeviceTypes`:: Specifies global settings for the cluster and is required.

`nodeMediatedDeviceTypes`:: Specifies global configuration overrides for a specific node or group of nodes and is optional. Must be used with the global `mediatedDeviceTypes` configuration.

`mediatedDeviceTypes`:: Specifies an override to the global `mediatedDeviceTypes` configuration for the specified nodes. Required if you use `nodeMediatedDeviceTypes`.

`nodeSelector`:: Specifies the node selector and must include a `key:value` pair. Required if you use `nodeMediatedDeviceTypes`.

`mdevNameSelector`:: Specifies the mediated devices that map to this value on the host.

`resourceName`:: Specifies the matching resource name that is allocated on the node.

. Save your changes and exit the editor.

.Verification

* Confirm that the virtual GPU is attached to the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get node <node_name> -o json \
  | jq '.status.allocatable \
  | with_entries(select(.key | startswith("nvidia.com/"))) \
  | with_entries(select(.value != "0"))'
