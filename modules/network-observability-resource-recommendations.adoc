= Resource management and performance considerations

The amount of resources required by network observability depends on the size of your cluster and your requirements for the cluster to ingest and store observability data. To manage resources and set performance criteria for your cluster, consider configuring the following settings. Configuring these settings might meet your optimal setup and observability needs.

The following settings can help you manage resources and performance from the outset:

eBPF Sampling:: You can set the Sampling specification, `spec.agent.ebpf.sampling`, to manage resources. By default, eBPF sampling is set to `50`, so a flow has a 1 in 50 chance of being sampled. A lower sampling interval value requires more computational, memory, and storage resources. A value of `0` or `1` means all flows are sampled. It is recommended to start with the default value and refine it empirically to determine the optimal setting for your cluster.

eBPF features:: The more features that are enabled, the more CPU and memory are impacted. See "Observing the network traffic" for a complete list of these features.

Without Loki:: You can reduce the amount of resources that network observability requires by not using Loki and instead relying on Prometheus. For example, when network observability is configured without Loki, the total savings of memory usage are in the 20-65% range and CPU utilization is lower by 10-30%, depending upon the sampling interval value. See "Network observability without Loki" for more information.

Restricting or excluding interfaces::  Reduce the overall observed traffic by setting the values for `spec.agent.ebpf.interfaces` and `spec.agent.ebpf.excludeInterfaces`. By default, the agent fetches all the interfaces in the system, except the ones listed in `excludeInterfaces` and `lo` (local interface). Note that the interface names might vary according to the Container Network Interface (CNI) used.

Performance fine-tuning:: The following settings can be used to fine-tune performance after the Network Observability has been running for a while:

* *Resource requirements and limits*: Adapt the resource requirements and limits to the load and memory usage you expect on your cluster by using the `spec.agent.ebpf.resources` and `spec.processor.resources` specifications. The default limits of 800MB might be sufficient for most medium-sized clusters.

* *Cache max flows timeout*: Control how often flows are reported by the agents by using the eBPF agent's `spec.agent.ebpf.cacheMaxFlows` and `spec.agent.ebpf.cacheActiveTimeout` specifications. A larger value results in less traffic being generated by the agents, which correlates with a lower CPU load. However, a larger value leads to a slightly higher memory consumption, and might generate more latency in the flow collection.
