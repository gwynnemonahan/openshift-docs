= Network Observability Operator 1.10 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability Operator 1.10 release contains several fixed issues that improve performance and the user experience.

[id="metricname-and-remap-fields-are-validated-flowmetrics_{context}"]
== MetricName and Remap fields are validated

Before this update, users could create a `FlowMetric` custom resource (CR) with an invalid metric name. Although the `FlowMetric` CR was successfully created, the underlying metric would fail silently without providing any error feedback to the user.

With this release, the `FlowMetric`, `metricName`, and `remap` fields are now validated before creation, so users are immediately notified if they enter an invalid name.

[id="export-overview-topology-freeze_{context}"]
== Improved html-to-image export performance

Before this update, performance issues in the underlying library caused the `html-to-image` export function to take a long time, leading to browser freezing.

With this release, the performance of the `html-to-image` library has been improved, reducing export wait times and eliminating browser freezing during image generation.

[id="improved-warning-messages-on-missing-privileged-mode-for-ebpf-features_{context}"]
== Improved warnings for eBPF privileged mode

Before this update, when users selected `eBPF` features that require `privileged` mode, the features would often fail without clearly informing the user that `privileged` mode was missing or needed to be enabled.

With this release, a validation hook immediately warns the user if the configuration is inconsistent. This improves user understanding and prevents misconfiguration.

[id="source-destination-subnet-labels-in-open-telemetry-exporter_{context}"]
== Subnet labels added to OpenTelemetry exporter

Before this update, the `OpenTelemetry` metrics exporter was missing the network flow labels `SrcSubnetLabel` and `DstSubnetLabel`, causing them to show as empty.

With this release, these labels are now correctly provided by the exporter. They have also been renamed to `source.subnet.label` and `destination.subnet.label` for improved clarity and consistency with `OpenTelemetry` standards.

[id="reduced-default-tolerations-for-network-observability-components_{context}"]
== Reduced default tolerations for network observability components
Before this update, a default toleration was set on all network observability components to allow them to be scheduled on any node, including those tainted with `NoSchedule`. This could potentially block cluster upgrades.

With this release, the default toleration is now only maintained for the `eBPF` agents and the `Flowlogs-Pipeline` when configured in `Direct` mode. The toleration has been removed from the {product-title} web console plugin and the `Flowlogs-Pipeline` when configured in `Kafka` mode.

Additionally, while tolerations were always configurable in the `FlowCollector` custom resource (CR), it was previously impossible to replace the tolerations with an empty list. It is now possible to replace the tolerations with an empty list.
