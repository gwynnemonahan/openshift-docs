= Network observability topology views

The {product-title} console offers the *Topology* tab which displays a graphical representation of the network flows and the amount of traffic. The topology view represents traffic between the {product-title} components as a network graph. You can refine the graph by using the filters and display options. You can access the information for cluster, zone, udn, node, namespace, owner, pod, and service.
