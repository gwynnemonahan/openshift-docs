= Accessing kubeconfig by using the oc CLI

You can use the `oc` CLI to log in to your OpenShift cluster and retrieve a kubeconfig file for accessing the cluster from the command line.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {product-title} web console or API server endpoint.

.Procedure

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login <api-server-url> -u <username> -p <password> <1><2><3>
----
+
<1> Specify the full API server URL. For example: `https://api.my-cluster.example.com:6443`.
<2> Specify a valid username. For example: `kubeadmin`.
<3> Provide the password for the specified user. For example, the `kubeadmin` password generated during cluster installation.

. Save the cluster configuration to a local file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc config view --raw > kubeconfig
----

. Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to point to the exported file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig
----

. Use `oc` to interact with your OpenShift cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

[NOTE]
====
If you plan to reuse the exported `kubeconfig` file across sessions or machines, store it securely and avoid committing it to source control.
