[role="_abstract"]
Before you can enable NUMA functionality with {VirtProductName} VMs, you must ensure that your environment meets the following prerequisites.

* Worker nodes must have huge pages enabled.
* The `KubeletConfig` object on worker nodes must be configured with the `cpuManagerPolicy: static` spec to guarantee dedicated CPU allocation, which is a prerequisite for NUMA pinning.
