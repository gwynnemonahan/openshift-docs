= Understanding Customer Cloud Subscriptions on {gcp-short}


Red Hat {product-title} provides a Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model that allows Red Hat to deploy and manage {product-title} into a customer's existing {GCP} account. Red Hat requires several prerequisites be met in order to provide this service.

Red Hat recommends the usage of {gcp-short} project, managed by the customer, to organize all of your {gcp-short} resources. A project consists of a set of users and APIs, as well as billing, authentication, and monitoring settings for those APIs.

It is recommended for the {product-title} cluster using a CCS model to be hosted in a {gcp-short} project within a {gcp-short} organization. The Organization resource is the root node of the {gcp-short} resource hierarchy and all resources that belong to an organization are grouped under the organization node. An IAM service account with certain roles granted is created and applied to the {gcp-short} project. When you make calls to the API, you typically provide service account keys for authentication. Each service account is owned by a specific project, but service accounts can be provided roles to access resources for other projects.
