= Performing RevisionBased update
:context: ossm-performing-revisionbased-update

When updating {istio} using the `RevisionBased` strategy, you may increment by more than one minor version at a time because the existing sidecars do not automatically connect to the new revision of the control plane. Instead, you must manually move the workloads to the new control plane.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator, and deployed {istio}.

.Procedure

. Change the version in the {istio} resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Istio
spec:
  version: v1.24.3
  updateStrategy:
    type: RevisionBased
----
+
The {SMProductShortName} Operator deploys a new version of the control plane alongside the old version of the control plane. The sidecars remain connected to the old control plane.

. Confirm that both revisions of the control plane are running and ready:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get istiorevisions
----

. Move the workloads to the new control plane by updating the `istio.io/rev` label on the application namespace or the pods to the revision name of the new control plane.

. Restart the application workloads so that the new version of the sidecar gets injected.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>
