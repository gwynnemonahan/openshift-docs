= About InPlace strategy
:context: ossm-about-inplace-strategy

The `InPlace` strategy runs only one revision of the control plane at all times. When you perform an `InPlace` update, all of the workloads immediately connect to the new version of the control plane. In order to ensure compatibility between the sidecars and the control plane you cannot upgrade by more than one minor version at a time.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Traffic disruption may occur during the upgrade process. To minimize the disruption, ensure that at least two replicas of `istiod` are running. Also, ensure that `PodDisruptionBudgets` fields are configured with a minimum availability of 1.
