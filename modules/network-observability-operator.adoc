= Network Observability Operator

The Network Observability Operator provides the `FlowCollector` API custom resource. A `FlowCollector` instance is a cluster-scoped resource that enables configuration of network flow collection. This instance deploys pods and services that form a monitoring pipeline.

The `eBPF` agent is deployed as a `daemonset` object and creates the network flows. The pipeline collects and enriches network flows with Kubernetes metadata before storing them in Loki or generating Prometheus metrics.
