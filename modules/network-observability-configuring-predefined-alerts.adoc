= Configuring predefined alerts

[role="_abstract"]
Alerts in the Network Observability Operator are defined using alert templates and variants in the `spec.processor.metrics.alerts` object of the `FlowCollector` custom resource (CR). You can customize the default templates and variants for flexible, fine-grained alerting.

After you enable alerts, the *Network Health* dashboard appears in the *Observe* section of the {product-title} web console.

For each template, you can define a list of variants, each with their own thresholds and grouping configurations. For more information, see the "List of default alert templates".

Here is an example:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1beta1
kind: FlowCollector
metadata:
  name: flow-collector
spec:
  processor:
    metrics:
      alerts:
      - template: PacketDropsByKernel
        variants:
        # triggered when the whole cluster traffic (no grouping) reaches 10% of drops
        - thresholds:
            critical: "10"
        # triggered when per-node traffic reaches 5% of drops, with gradual severity
        - thresholds:
            critical: "15"
            warning: "10"
            info: "5"
          groupBy: Node

[NOTE]
====
Customizing an alert replaces the default configuration for that template. If you want to keep the default configurations, you must manually replicate them.
