= {PM-shortname-c} dashboards overview

There are two types of {PM-shortname} dashboards. Both provide different levels of details around power consumption metrics for a single cluster:

[id="power-monitoring-overview-dashboard_{context}"]
== Power Monitor / Overview dashboard

This dashboard allows you to view the following information:

Cluster-wide power consumption:: View current total, active, and idle CPU power consumption, grouped by zones.
Node-level power details:: Analyze historical and current power consumption (total, active, and idle) for individual nodes.
Hardware information:: Display CPU model and core counts for each node in the cluster.
Time-series analysis:: Track power consumption trends over time with graphs that can be filtered by node and zone. This provides a comprehensive view of your cluster's energy usage.

[id="power-monitor-namespace-pods-dashboard_{context}"]
== Power Monitor / Namespace (Pods) dashboard

This dashboard allows you to monitor and analyze power consumption for Kubernetes namespaces and pods. It provides the following information:

Top ten power consuming namespaces:: A real-time table showing the top ten namespaces based on their current power usage. This helps you quickly identify the most resource-intensive workloads.
Total namespace power consumption:: A historical graph showing the total power consumption of pods within a selected namespace over time, grouped by zone. This helps you see trends and understand an application's or service's total power use.
Individual pod power consumption:: A detailed graph showing the power consumption of individual pods, so you can analyze them in detail.
