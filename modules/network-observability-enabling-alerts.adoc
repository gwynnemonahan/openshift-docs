= Enabling Technology Preview alerts in network observability

[role="_abstract"]
Network Observability Operator alerts are a Technology Preview feature. To use this feature, you must enable it in the `FlowCollector` custom resource (CR), and then continue with configuring alerts to your specific needs.

.Procedure

. Edit the `FlowCollector` CR to set the experimental alerts flag to `true`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1beta1
kind: FlowCollector
metadata:
  name: flow-collector
spec:
  processor:
    advanced:
      env:
        EXPERIMENTAL_ALERTS_HEALTH: "true"
----

You can still use the existing method for creating alerts. For more information, see "Creating alerts".

//for NetObserv 1.10, specific to new alerts functionality and new health dashboard as a Technology Preview feature. This may or may not be needed when the feature GA's.
//Kept the ID generic but the title specific to Technology Preview, just in case this needs to be updated for GA, then only the title will change and not the URL or ID, so xrefs should still function.
