= About network observability alerts

[role="_abstract"]
Network observability includes predefined alerts. Use these alerts to gain insight into the health and performance of your {product-title} applications and infrastructure.

The predefined alerts provide a quick health indication of your cluster's network in the *Network Health* dashboard. You can also customize alerts using Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries.

By default, network observability creates alerts that are contextual to the features you enable.

For example, packet drop-related alerts are created only if the `PacketDrop` agent feature is enabled in the `FlowCollector` custom resource (CR). Alerts are built on metrics, and you might see configuration warnings if enabled alerts are missing their required metrics.

You can configure these metrics in the `spec.processor.metrics.includeList` object of the `FlowCollector` CR.

[id="network-observability-default-alert-templates_{context}"]
== List of default alert templates

These alert templates are installed by default:

`PacketDropsByDevice`:: Triggers on high percentage of packet drops from devices (`/proc/net/dev`).
`PacketDropsByKernel`:: Triggers on high percentage of packet drops by the kernel; it requires the `PacketDrop` agent feature.
`IPsecErrors`:: Triggers when IPsec encryption errors are detected by network observability; it requires the `IPSec` agent feature.
`NetpolDenied`:: Triggers when traffic denied by network policies is detected by network observability; it requires the `NetworkEvents` agent feature.
`LatencyHighTrend`:: Triggers when an increase of TCP latency is detected by network observability; it requires the `FlowRTT` agent feature.
`DNSErrors`:: Triggers when DNS errors are detected by network observability; it requires the `DNSTracking` agent feature.
//* `ExternalEgressHighTrend`: TODO.
//* `ExternalIngressHighTrend`: TODO.

These are operational alerts that relate to the self-health of network observability:

`NetObservNoFlows`:: Triggers when no flows are being observed for a certain period.
`NetObservLokiError`:: Triggers when flows are being dropped due to Loki errors.

You can configure, extend, or disable alerts for network observability. You can view the resulting `PrometheusRule` resource in the default `netobserv` namespace by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get prometheusrules -n netobserv -oyaml

[id="network-health-dashboard_{context}"]
== Network Health dashboard

When alerts are enabled in the Network Observability Operator, two things happen:

* New alerts appear in *Observe* → *Alerting* → *Alerting rules* tab in the {product-title} web console.
* A new *Network Health* dashboard appears in {product-title} web console → *Observe*.

The *Network Health* dashboard provides a summary of triggered alerts and pending alerts, distinguishing between critical, warning, and minor issues. Alerts for rule violations are displayed in the following tabs:

* *Global*: Shows alerts that are global to the cluster.
* *Nodes*: Shows alerts for rule violations per node.
* *Namespaces*: Shows alerts for rule violations per namespace.

Click on a resource card to see more information. Next to each alert, a three dot menu appears. From this menu, you can navigate to *Network Traffic* → *Traffic flows* to see more detailed information for the selected resource.
