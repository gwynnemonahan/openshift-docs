= The {microshift-short} YAML configuration file

At startup, {microshift-short} checks the system-wide `/etc/microshift/` directory for a configuration file named `config.yaml`. If the configuration file does not exist in the directory, built-in default values are used to start the service.

You must use the {microshift-short} configuration file must be used in combination with host and, sometimes, application and service settings. Ensure that you configure each function in tandem, as needed, when you adjust settings for your {microshift-short} cluster.

For your convenience, a `config.yaml.default` file ready for your inputs is automatically installed.
