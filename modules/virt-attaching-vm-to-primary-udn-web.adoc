= Attaching a virtual machine to the primary user-defined network by using the web console

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to the primary user-defined network (UDN) by using the {product-title} web console. VMs that are created in a namespace where the primary UDN is configured are automatically attached to the UDN with the Layer 2 bridge network binding plugin.

To attach a VM to the primary UDN by using the Plug a Simple Socket Transport (passt) binding, enable the plugin and configure the VM network interface in the web console.
