* ** ImageDigestMirrorSets (IDMS) now supported.**
{product-title} now supports ImageDigestMirrorSets (IDMS), enabling clusters to redirect image pulls to a private, mirrored registry. This critical enhancement means customers in air-gapped or restricted networks can host their own mirrors for third-party images while satisfying strict security and compliance requirements. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html-single/images/index#images-registry-mirroring_image-configuration-hcp[Image registry mirroring for {product-title}].
