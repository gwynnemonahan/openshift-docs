For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html-single/cluster_administration/index#rosa-managing-worker-nodes[Managing compute nodes].

* ** ImageDigestMirrorSets (IDMS) now supported.**
{product-title} now supports ImageDigestMirrorSets (IDMS), enabling clusters to redirect image pulls to a private, mirrored registry.

* **Extended Update Support (EUS) channel group now available.**
You can now select the EUS channel group when creating or editing your {product-title} cluster.
