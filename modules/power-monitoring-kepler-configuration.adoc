= The {PM-kepler} configuration

You can configure {PM-kepler} with the `spec` field of the `PowerMonitor` resource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the name of your `PowerMonitor` instance is `power-monitor`. All other instances are rejected by the {PM-operator} Webhook.
====

The following is the list of configuration options:

.PowerMonitor configuration options
[cols="1,3,2", options="header"]
|===
| Name
| Description
| Default Behavior

| deployment.nodeSelector
| The nodes on which Kepler (created by PowerMonitor) pods are scheduled.
| kubernetes.io/os: linux

| deployment.tolerations
| The tolerations for Power Monitor that allow the pods to be scheduled on nodes with specific characteristics.
| - operator: "Exists"

| deployment.security.mode
| Security mode can be set to either `none`, allowing unrestricted access to Kepler's metrics by any entity, or `rbac`, securing the metrics endpoint with TLS encryption and restricting access to authorized service accounts listed in `allowedSANames`.
| Set to `rbac` by default and only user workload prometheus is allowed access.

| deployment.security.allowedSANames
| A list of Service Account Names that can access Keplerâ€™s metrics endpoint when security mode is `rbac`.
| In OpenShift, set to `openshift-user-workload-monitoring:prometheus-user-workload` to allow user workload monitoring to scrape Kepler.

| config.logLevel
| The level of logs to expose by Kepler.
| Set to info.

| config.metricLevels
| A list of energy metric levels to expose. Possible values include `node`, `process`, `container`, `vm`, and `pod`.
| The default list includes `node`, `pod`, and `vm`.

| config.staleness
| Specifies how long to wait before considering calculated power values as stale.
| 500ms (500 milliseconds).

| config.sampleRate
| Specifies the interval for monitoring resources such as processes, containers, and VMs.
| 5s (5 seconds).

| config.maxTerminated
| Controls terminated workload tracking. A negative value tracks unlimited workloads, zero disables tracking, and a positive value tracks the top N terminated workloads by energy consumption.
| 500.
