= About RevisionBased strategy
:context: ossm-about-revisionbased-strategy

An update that is performed using  the `RevisionBased` strategy runs two revisions of a control plane. This capability allows you to gradually migrate workloads from the old control plane to the new control plane, making canary upgrades possible. The `RevisionBased` strategy also allows you to update by more than one minor version.
