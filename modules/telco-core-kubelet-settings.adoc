Some CNF workloads make use of sysctls which are not in the list of system-wide safe sysctls. Generally network sysctls are namespaced and can be enabled by using the `kubeletconfig.experimental` annotation in the PerformanceProfile as a string of JSON in the form `allowedUnsafeSysctls`.

.Example snippet showing allowedUnsafeSysctls

[source,yaml]

apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  name: {{ .metadata.name }}
  annotations:kubeletconfig.experimental: |
      {"allowedUnsafeSysctls":["net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra"]}

[NOTE]
====
Although these are namespaced they may allow a pod to consume memory or other resources beyond any limits specified in the pod description. You must ensure that these sysctls do not exhaust platform resources.
