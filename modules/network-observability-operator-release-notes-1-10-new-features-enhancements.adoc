= Network Observability Operator 1.10 new features and enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability Operator 1.10 release enhances security, improves performance, and introduces new CLI UI tools for better network flow management.

[id="network-policy-updates_{context}"]
== Network policy updates
The Network Observability Operator now supports configuring both ingress and egress network policies to control pod traffic. This enhancement improves security.

By default, the `spec.NetworkPolicy.enable` specification is now set to `true`. This means that if you use Loki or Kafka, it is recommended that you deploy the Loki Operator and Kafka instances into dedicated namespaces. This ensures that the network policies can be configured correctly to allow communication between all components.
//check if deploying Loki and Kafka in dedicated namespaces is included in the updated network policy, "Configuring network policy". Might need to add an IMPORTANT admonition to that section.

[id="network-observability-operator-cli-ui-updates_{context}"]
