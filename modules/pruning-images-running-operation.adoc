= Running image prune operations

Use the following procedure to run an image prune operation

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged into the CLI with an access token.
* You must have the `system:image-pruner` cluster role or greater (for example, `cluster-admin`).
* The image registry must be exposed.
* You have reviewed the "Considerations when manually pruning images" section of this document.

.Procedure

. Optional: To preview which images would be pruned, enter the following command. This command prints a list of the images, image streams, and pods that would be removed. Note that nothing is deleted until you add the `--confirm` flag.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune images <image_prune_option_one> <image_prune_option_two> <1>
----
<1> For more information about available pruning options, see "Manual image pruning command options".


. Review the output to confirm the list of images, image streams, and pods to be removed.

. Run the `oc adm prune images` command with the appropriate options for your cluster. Add the `--confirm` flag to confirm deletion. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune images <image_prune_option_one> <image_prune_option_two> --confirm
----
