= Control Plane Only updates

Every even-numbered minor version of {product-title} is an Extended Update Support (EUS) version. However, Kubernetes design mandates serial minor version updates, so you cannot directly update from one EUS version to the next. An EUS-to-EUS update starts with updating {VirtProductName} to the latest z-stream of the next odd-numbered minor version. Next, update {product-title} to the target EUS version. When the {product-title} update succeeds, the corresponding update for {VirtProductName} becomes available. You can now update {VirtProductName} to the target EUS version.

[NOTE]
====
You can directly update {VirtProductName} to the latest z-stream release of your current minor version without applying each intermediate z-stream update.
====

For more information about EUS versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].

[id="prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

Before beginning a Control Plane Only update, you must:

* Pause worker nodes' machine config pools before you start a Control Plane Only update so that the workers are not rebooted twice.

* Disable automatic workload updates before you begin the update process. This is to prevent {VirtProductName} from migrating or evicting your virtual machines (VMs) until you update to your target EUS version.

[NOTE]
====
By default, {VirtProductName} automatically updates workloads, such as the `virt-launcher` pod, when you update the {VirtProductName} Operator. You can configure this behavior in the `spec.workloadUpdateStrategy` stanza of the `HyperConverged` custom resource.
