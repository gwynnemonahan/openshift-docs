You can add or remove virtual disks without stopping your virtual machine (VM) or virtual machine instance (VMI).

Only data volumes and persistent volume claims (PVCs) can be hot plugged and hot-unplugged. You cannot hot plug or hot-unplug container disks.

A hot plugged disk remains attached to the VM even after reboot. You must unplug the disk to remove it from the VM.

[NOTE]
====
Each VM has a `virtio-scsi` controller so that hot plugged disks can use the SCSI bus. The `virtio-scsi` controller overcomes the limitations of VirtIO while retaining its performance advantages. It is highly scalable and supports hot plugging over 4 million disks.

When you hot plug disks to the VirtIO (`virtio-blk`) bus, each disk uses a PCI Express (PCIe) slot in the VM. The number of PCIe slots is limited and pre-set automatically at the VM creation as specified in the link:https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/storage/hotplug_volumes/#available-virtio-ports[Available VirtIO Ports] table. Therefore, you can use `virtio-blk` for a small number of disks that does not exceed the number of available slots.
